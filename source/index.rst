   Glossary

**The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications.**
From drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms to powerful developer tools, ROS has the open source tools you need for your next robotics project.

Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community.
The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isnâ€™t.

For ROS 1 documentation, check out the `ROS wiki <https://wiki.ros.org>`__.
